- STEP 2: Find and save the CIF file that you want to convert to a QE file in the CIF directory
For 2D structures: https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/mc2d/dashboard/ptable
For 3D structures: https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/mc3d/dashboard/ptable

- STEP 3: Run the following command to convert the CIF file to a QE file:
For 2D structures:
$ python cif2vc-relax-2D.py
For 3D structures:
$ python cif2vc-relax-3D.py 

The QE file will be saved in the vc-relax directory
